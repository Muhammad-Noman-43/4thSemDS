# 📚 Data Structures in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures that I'm currently learning in my university coursework. I’m writing these classes as part of my practice to understand and master each data structure one at a time.

## 📂 Structure

Each file in the repository represents a different data structure implemented using Java. For example:
- `SinglyLinkedList.java` – Implementation of a singly linked list.
- `DoublyLinkedList.java` – Implementation of a doubly linked list.
- `CircularLinkedList.java` – Implementation of a circular linked list.
- `StackUsingArray.java` – Stack implemented using an array.
- `StackUsingLL.java` – Stack implemented using a linked list.
- `NotationsWithStack` - Conversion and evaluation of prefix, postfix, and infix expressions
- `QueueusingArray` - Implementation of Queue using an array
- `QueueUsingLL` - Implementation of Queue using a linked list
- `QueueUsingCircularArray` - Implementation of Queue using a circular array
- `QueueUsingStack` - Implementation of Queue using stacks
- `PrioritQueue` - Implementation of Priority Queues using already built queues
- `BST` - Implementation of Binary Search Tree
- `AVL` - Implementation of Adelson-Velsky and Landis Tree (self-balancing tree)
- `Graphs` - (Coming soon...)


More structures will be added as I continue learning.

## 💻 Tools

- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 

## 🚫 Notes

- Compiled `.class` files and the `out/` directory (created by IntelliJ IDEA) are not included in this repository.
- Only source code (`.java` files) is tracked for simplicity and clarity.

## 🏗️ Work in Progress

This is a learning project, so updates will happen regularly as I cover more topics in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

## 📜 License

This project is for educational purposes. Feel free to explore and learn from it!
